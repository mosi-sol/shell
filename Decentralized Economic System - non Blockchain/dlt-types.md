Several types of **Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs)**:

1. **Blockchain**: A decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger that uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions.

2. **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: A type of DLT that uses a network of nodes to verify transactions and does not require a central authority or mining process.

3. **Hashgraph**: A patented consensus algorithm that uses a voting mechanism to reach consensus on transactions.

4. **Holochain**: A DLT that uses a peer-to-peer architecture and is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure.

5. **Tangle**: A type of DLT used by the IOTA network that uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a traditional blockchain to process transactions.

6. **Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA)**: A consensus algorithm used by Stellar that allows transactions to be validated by a group of trusted nodes rather than by all nodes in the network.

7. **Corda**: A DLT designed for use in finance and other industries that uses a permissioned network and allows for the sharing of information between parties while keeping certain information private.

8. **MultiChain**: A permissioned blockchain platform that allows users to create and manage their own blockchain networks.

9. **Hyperledger Fabric**: A permissioned blockchain platform that is designed for use in enterprise settings and allows for the creation of private, permissioned blockchain networks.

10. **EOSIO**: A blockchain platform that uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and is designed to be scalable and efficient for decentralized applications (dApps).
