# Blockchain simulator
Nodejs blockchain simulator

run:
- run `npm i`
- node version > 19
- first way:`npm run me` or `node mosisolSimulator` (don't have log file)
- alternative way: using `run-and-log.bat` to run project mock & save json as "log"
- look at `block-scan.html` is/as block explorer (mock data)

Enjoy!
